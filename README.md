# Project 0 - Web Portfolio

This project will serve as a starting point for my personal web portfolio. The front page provides 6 links to 5 different galleries and an About Me page:
* Data Visualization - showcasing data visualization projects.
* Built Environment - showing projects in architecture and architectural engineering.
* Interaction Design - projects involving AR and other interactive technologies.
* Graphic Design - gallery of graphic design projects (e.g. posters, diagrams, etc.)
* About Me - A brief introduction and some CV items organized in a table.
* Random Tiny Projects - a gallery of assorted fun projects that don't particularly belong to any of the other categories (e.g. cooking experiments, etc.). The ![Question Icon](https://holistudio.github.com/images/xyz.png)icon shown on the front page is a question mark copied and rotated in a circle.

Both the front page and the About Me page's appearances change according to screen size using @media queries.

Current gallery pages show grey image placeholders and will be updated with actual projects and images at a later time.
